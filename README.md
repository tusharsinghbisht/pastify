# Pastify

### (project currently in development phase)

**Pastify** is a minimalistic Python web framework inspired by Flask, built using the unix socket API. It aims to provide a lightweight, easy-to-understand alternative for learning the basics of web frameworks and HTTP handling. With Pastify, developers can define routes, handle HTTP requests, and send responses without relying on external web server dependencies.
